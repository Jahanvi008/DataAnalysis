# DataAnalysis
In this project, I analyze the data set following the key aspects of the data science workflow.

This data science project explores the dataset containing information about Stroke Prognosis and explores the relationship between Health Factors and Stroke Incidence.

The essential aspects of the data science workflow followed are:
    1. Locating data
    2. Importing Data(into Python)
    3. Cleaning data
    4. Exploratory analysis to form a question
    5. Answer questions with statistical and/or machine learning models
    6. Communicate your process and findings in the form of written text, that includes               generated image/plot

Later on in this project, the major health factors are compared with the stroke incidences based on gender and age, and conclusions are drawn from the data set.
